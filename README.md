# Capstone2---CPAs-fees-pattern
Capstone project 2: Professional Certified Public Accountants working patterns 

In this capstone project, I examine auditorsâ€™ (CPAs) patterns in charging professional services fees to their clients. Understanding such patterns by professional people is vital because fees billing by professional people is an effective surrogate to examine their input and work quality. The quality of certain types of professional work would have a significant spillover effect on the community and capital market. If the fees charged too low might harm the market competition, it appears to be suspicious of the project content if the fees are set abnormally too high. 

I used the public data of each CPA firm and their associated audit fees charged to each client to construct an analytical table by using the data wrangling technique. Specifically, in the uploaded dataset, id refers to CPA firm ID, stkcd refers to the companies ID audited by each CPA firm.  

I used the trained unsupervised learning model with K-Means clustering algorithms. I develop working patterns based on their (ab)normal fees charged to clients ground by work utility function to detect the cluster groups that might interest the regulator.
